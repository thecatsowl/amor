    <h1>A Thread in Pop Culture Via a Personal Script</h1>
      <p>
	  "The medium is the message" is a phrase coined by the theorist Marshall McLuhan. He punned on the word "message," invoking 
	  such derivatives such as "mass age," "mess age," and "massage." With this idea, he meant that we have a web of images and 
	  communication to contend with now. This is true of popular culture. Each narrative is its own configurations, interwoven in 
	  algorithms, social media, the Internet, film, music, and television. Most people are more comfortable now with series on 
	  Netflix, HBOMax, and YouTube than they are with conventional radio and television.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  If Feminism is the source code, as it were, than Popular Culture is the User Interface to this code. And because Popular Culture
	  is increasingly influenced by algorithms, it would be a good idea to encourage Women, Queer People, and Gender Non-Conforming 
	  Individuals to learn code.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  In "Believing Is Seeing: Biology as Ideology" by Judith Lorber, the author states under the heading, "Dirty Little Secrets,"
	  that "[a]s sports construct gendered bodies, technology constructs gendered skills." She goes on to state that women are
	  not very well represented in the Computer Science profession.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  A community of artists and programmers would develop a style to weave a thread into the fabric of Popular Culture. But whereas
	  the medium is the message, we Feminists, Queer and Gender Non-Conforming Individuals should imbibe the medium in order to 
	  better understand the configuration of images, language and style so as to improve the fabric in favor of Feminism.
