    <h1>Legally Blonde Analysis</h1>
      <p>

Step 0: watch and read

	  </p>
	  <p>
Step 1: summarize text --> What is Doleâ€™s central argument about third-wave feminism in this article?
		How women's anxieties about balancing femininity and power play out in mainstream films
		marketed to American women. Femininity and Feminism. We do not have a consensus on whether 
		women can have it all.	
		</p>
		<p>
		Dole thinks Elle Woods is typical of third-wave feminism by her tenacity and embracement of 
		fashion sense and especially the color pink. Elle is also less interested in social matters
		and more interested in her sorority, fashion and her private social circle. Second-wave feminism
		was much more interested in social justice and social change. The limitations of 
		Femininity are explored through the Bunny costume as a signifier of social humiliation.
		Dole also analyzes the Video Essay scene, wherein Elle applies to Harvard and submits
		a video essay; Dole cites Stella Bruzzi and believes costume is its own character in the movie.
		The scene wherein Elle is derided as a "Malibu Barbie" is also analyzed and referenced with
		ideas from Joan Riviere; incidentally, Dole places an acute accent mark over the penultimate "e"
		in Reviere's name, although Reviere is a British psychoanalyst, not a French one. Riviere's 
		insight is that women may use the Feminine Masquerade to cirumvent men's aggressive and
		paranoid nature. 
		</p>
		<p>
Step 2: analyze the film --> 
		{plot} The movie was intended to be tongue-in-cheek, or, as Dole points out, tongue-in-chic.
		The movie takes serious topics and subtly pokes fun of them, sometimes not so subtly.
		This is done through color and imagery. 
		Three colors predominate as visual language; in addition to the color pink, purple and blue
		are used. 
		Orange is also used as a symbol of confinement.
		</p>

		<p>
		Pink is used as a symbol for Emphatic Femininity. The Makeover is subverted whereby Girlie
		Playfulness and Dressup are at the beginning of the film; usually, the Makeover Scene is
		towards the end of a story, wherein a powerless person, usually a woman or girl, is 
		remade for an event. In the begininning of Legally Blonde, the events and the color pink are the main
		focus at the beginning of the film, where pink and social events and parties abound in Elle's life
		at Delta Nu and CULA (an obvious nod to UCLA.) The credits at the beginning of the movie 
		are also in pink.
		</p>
		<p>
		Interestingly, Professor Stromwell's eyeshadow is also pink. Elle's eyeshadow is blue, especially
		when she's inspired by a moment of insight. This is the color eyeshadow Elle wears when 
		she realizes at the start of the film while at the beauty salon that she must be a Harvard Law Student if she's ever to 
		get Warner back.
		Dole writes that the color blue signifies "authentic friendship and selfhood."
		</p>
		<p>
		During and after Elle is humiliated by Vivian and Warner at the School Party at 8 o'clock at 45 Dunston Street, Elle
		wears a purple eyeshadow; some of the pink she wears also blurs into a light purple.
		Purple is the color used at the end for the graduation ceremony. Purple is used to signify royalty. There are scenes
		wherein a character plays a powerful role and wears purple, such as when Vivian agrees to have Elle kicked out of 
		class for not being prepared and is wearing a purple headband. When Chutney Windham makes her first appearance,
		whe's wearing a purple jacket. 
		</p>
		<p>
		At the beginning of the film when Elle first enters Harvard Law School, she shares with her fellow Law Students
		how she convinced Cameron Diaz not to buy a "truly heinous" angora sweater at Fred Segal. She then goes on to say that "whoever 
		said orange is the new pink was seriously disturbed." Later in the film, Brooke Taylor calls Elle an angel (after
		Elle proclaims that she brought her the Bible in the form of a Cosmopolitan magazine, in addition to other beauty products
		in a wicker basket.) Elle notes that Brooke looks so "orange" in jail and in Brooke's jail issued orange jumpsuit.
		This juxtaposition of orange and spiritual signifiers is taken further when Elle buys her laptop: an orange Apple iBook.
		The Apple logo is also a clever reference to the Biblical apple and Original Sin (even though the original word in 
		Hebrew connotes a fruit more akin to a fig than an apple, theology over the course of centuries has replaced this with 
		the image of an apple.) Elle is also emphasized as the Spiritual Madonna in the water fountain scene, when Enrique 
		walks away from her: the shot holds the Virgin of Guadalupe to the left of Elle while she strikes a similar pose to
		the Virgin Icon on the right. Incidentally, Enrique does a "bend and snap" after Elle taps her Prada shoe impatiently after
		Enrique cuts in the line to drink water in front of her. Enrique here is the Whore in the Madonna/Whore complex, having sold
		out his testimony for money and hiding his Gay identity for profit.
		</p>
		<p>
		In addition to color, dogs are used to re-imagine the sexist slur for an empowered woman; but whereas a female dog is 
		used as the slur, male dogs with rugged names are used. Bruiser is Elle's pet dog, whereas Rufus is the name for Paulette's dog.
		Though the film ends with captions explaining that Vivian is Elle's new best friend, it seems that Paulette is 
		closer to that in the original film. Dole explains that the ending with the captions was added in order to please
		test audiences. When Elle empowers Paulette to take back her dog from her abusive ex-boyfriend, Paulette proclaims, "I'm 
		taking the dog -- dumbass!" This signifies that the woman is taking back her own personal agency, which a man has 
		appropriated. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Later in the film, when Vivian is impressed by Elle's refusal to divulge her client and sorority sister's alibi, Vivian
		is encouraged to hold Bruiser; this implies that Elle is lending Vivian some agency, which both women use to dump 
		Warner at the end.
